CONTENTdm stats program

This simple script filters and aggregates usage information from the Apache access.log. 

RUN STEPS:
------

0a. open hits.sh and modify the following variables:
  orgname='myorg'
  orgsubnet='192.168'
  accesslog='/var/log/httpd/access_log'
  contentdbs='/path/to/contentdm/contentdbs/'
0b. chmod hits.sh appropriately: (ie chmod 755 hits.sh)
1. lists the collections in the CONTENTdm collection folder
2. filters the access.log for each collection in the following groupings:
  search engine robot
  real person
  people from my organization
  people from outside of my organization
  total hits
3. prints the data to STDOUT in pipe-delimited format

Step 3 can be piped to mail, or to any custom reporting program on the command line. 

TO AUTOMATE:
------------

Add the following to your crontab, (make sure that your user can do an ls on the collections directory, and also read the Apache access.log):

1 1 * * * /path/to/hits.sh | mail -s "$(date) Contentdm collection hits" myemail@example.com, theiremail@example.com 

This will run the program every day at 1:01am.
